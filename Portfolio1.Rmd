In this portfolio I explore The Americans and Arts study. Which is "is a series of studies measuring participation in and attitudes about the arts and arts in education." The study took place during the years of 1973, 1975, 1980, 1984, 1987, and 1992. In general my goal is took look at various questions asked in this data set regarding attitudes towards the arts and how they've changed over time. 


First let's load the data
```{r load-data}

#1973
load("DS0001/35575-0001-Data.rda")
D1973<-da35575.0001
rm(da35575.0001)

#1975
load("DS0002/35575-0002-Data.rda")
D1975<-da35575.0002
rm(da35575.0002)

#1980
load("DS0003/35575-0003-Data.rda")
D1980<-da35575.0003
rm(da35575.0003)

#1984
load("DS0004/35575-0004-Data.rda")
D1984<-da35575.0004
rm(da35575.0004)

#1987
load("DS0005/35575-0005-Data.rda")
D1987<-da35575.0005
rm(da35575.0005)

#1992
load("DS0006/35575-0006-Data.rda")
D1987<-da35575.0006
rm(da35575.0006)
